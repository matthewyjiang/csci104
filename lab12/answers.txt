If p is a prime and p | ab, gcd(p, a) = 1. 

By the above theorem, if p | ab and gcd(p,a) = 1, then p | b. 

Therefore, p | a or p | b.

To prove the property of double hashing, we need to prove that for the first p probes, that for any h and k in [0, p-1] that 
h+c*k mod p for all c [0,p-1] are all unique.

Proof by contradiction:

Given two different probes (h+a*k) mod p and (h+b*k) mod p where a != b and a, b in [0,p-1],
assume they fall at the same location. Then,

h+a*k = h+b*k (mod p)
a*k = b*k (mod p)
k*(a-b) = 0 (mod p)


This means that either p | k or p | a-b.

However, this is not possible since k < p and |a-b| < p. 

Therefore, the first p probes are all unique.
