1a. 1 - (995 choose 5)/(1000 choose 5)

1b. (5 choose 5)/(1000 choose 5)

2. 1/3 * 2/3 + 1/3 + 1/3*1/3 = 2/3 Law of total probability

3. (6*5*4*3*2*1)/(6^6) = 0.01543209876

4. P(at least 4 female) = (5 choose 4)*0.5^5 + 0.5^
   P(all 5 are female) = 0.5^5
   by conditional probability
   P(all 5 are female | at least 4 female) = 0.5^5 / (5 choose 4)*0.5^5 + 0.5^5 = 0.1666

5. P(X = x) = (6 choose x)(7 choose 2-x)/(13 choose 2)
   E(X) = 2 * 6 / 13 = 12/13 = 0.923076923075
